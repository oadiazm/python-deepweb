#### <a name="1"></a>1. Short introduction to Tor network.

[Tor (The Onion Router)](https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html) network is free software and open network that allows people to improve their privacy and security on the Internet.

Tor clients are connected to Tor network through an encrypted circuit. Each circuit is formed with three nodes [Entry]<->[Middle]<->[Exit].

Tor Client "visible" IP address will be the IP address from the exit node. In other words, Tor client will be hidden behind Tor circuit and is able to go through the Internet annonimously.

To know more about how Tor network works (recommended) visit [Tor website](https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html#thesolution).

Tor can't solve all anonymity problems. _**Tor only protects your applications that are properly configured to send their Internet traffic through Tor**_. There are some threats regarding annonimity that can reval your real identity like malicious [Javascript](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#TBBJavaScriptEnabled) in some websites, [DNS traffic monitoring](https://www.hackread.com/tor-dns-traffic-monitoring/) and some other thirdparty software.


#### <a name="2"></a>2. Tor client installation (Ubuntu Linux) and configuration (torrc file).

##### Installation

Tor client is available for Linux and OSX. Find full installation instructions at [nstallation guides section](https://www.torproject.org/docs/installguide.html.en) (left menu).

Installing Tor client in Debian/Ubuntu Linux is so easy:

`sudo apt-get install tor`

##### Configuration

By default Tor client uses port **9050 for SOCKS traffic**.

Controlling Tor client is possible by configuring *torrc* file in order to enable *ControlPort* option. Tis way, we can control Tor service from our Python programs.

We're going to configure our localhost Tor service like this:

  * SOCKS traffic port: **9050**

  * Control port: **9051**

  * Control Password: "**aVerySecurePassword**"

```bash
echo "RunAsDaemon 1" | sudo tee --append /etc/tor/torrc
echo "SOCKSPort localhost:9050" | sudo tee --append /etc/tor/torrc
echo "ControlPort localhost:9051" | sudo tee --append /etc/tor/torrc
echo "HashedControlPassword $(tor --hash-password aVerySecurePassword)" | sudo tee --append /etc/tor/torrc
sudo service tor restart 
```

Now our Tor service is runnig and we can control it through port 9051.


#### <a name="3"></a>3. From SOCKS to HTTP: empowering Tor with Privoxy.

Tor only works for TCP streams and can be used by any application with SOCKS support.

According to OSI model, [SOCKS protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1928) is an a intermediate layer between layer 3 (Network) and Layer 4 (Transport). Initially it was intended to be a way to pass traffic through firewalls. SOCKS v5 supports both transport protocols, TCP and UDP.

![SOCKS and OSI](./img/socks_on_OSI.jpg)

As you can figure out, not all applications can use Tor, because not all applications supports SOCKS. We can solve it by adding an a HTTP proxy server, like [Privoxy](https://www.privoxy.org/), to our system.

Our goal is to provide all applications access Tor network. This scheme shows how all these pieces fit together:

![our goal](./img/Tor_and_Privoxy.png)

Privoxy full installation and configuration manual is available in [its website](https://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/index.html). For our purposes, it's enough with these few commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install privoxy
echo "forward-socks5   /               127.0.0.1:9050 ." | sudo tee --append /etc/privoxy/config > /dev/null
sudo service privoxy restart
```

And that's it! we're ready to play arround with Python in the deep web :)
